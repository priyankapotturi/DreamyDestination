Located in the sacred town of Puri, the Jagannath Temple or the pride of India was built in the 11th century by King 
Indradyumna. This glorious temple is the abode of Lord Jagannath who is a form of Lord Vishnu. It is the most revered 
pilgrimage site for Hindus and is included in the pious Char Dham Yatra with Badrinath, Dwarka and Rameshwaram.
Apart from the main shrine that rises high, many minor temples within the complex will make you feel like you have entered 
God's home itself.

    The splendid Oriya architecture of the Jagannath Puri Temple is an icing on the cake. 
    The four gates are beautifully designed with intricate carvings. The scrumptious Mahaprasad of the temple is 
    something you should not miss. In one of the largest kitchens of India, the lip-smacking food is cooked in earthen 
    pots for thousands every day and offered to devotees. The vibrant religious festivals of the town allures tourists in 
    large numbers. The most awaited of them is the Rath Yatra celebrated with immense gusto. The colourful ambience, 
    interesting rituals, vim and vigour of the pilgrims is worth witnessing.
