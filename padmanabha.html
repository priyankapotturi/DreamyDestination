One of the 108 Divya Desams, Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple is located in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala.
 Embellished in gold-plated covering, the temple is opened only to Hindu followers. Dedicated to Lord Padmanabha; one of 
 the avatars of Lord Vishnu, the Padmanabhaswamy Temple is one of the principal centres of Vaishnava worship in the dharma
of Vaishnavism.

Built as a replica of the Adikesavaperumal Temple in Thiruvattar,
 the Padmanabhaswamy temple is well-preserved antiquity. Although the origin of this temple still remains a mystery,
  devotees believe it to have existed since the first day of the Kali Yuga, which was 5000 years ago. 
  The Padmanabhaswamy temple also has a mention in the Bhagwad Gita. The scripture states that Balarama, 
  the older brother of Lord Krishna frequented the temple, 
  bathed in the Padmatheertham and also made several offerings the deity here.
